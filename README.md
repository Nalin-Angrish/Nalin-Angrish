## What I Do
I am a Mechanical Engineering student at IIT Ropar, and I learn to code and build some real-life software projects (some non-software projects soon too!). Want to see some of my projects? Visit [my website](https://www.nalinangrish.me/).  

## My Favourite creation
[IdeaGenius](https://github.com/Nalin-Angrish/IdeaGenius)  
IdeaGenius is a platform for seamless Market Research Assistance and Innovative Ideation. It empowers users with diverse information collection and organization, generating unique ideas from aggregated research.  

I made this project along with my seniors [Parth Jain](https://github.com/Parth-Jain-2002), [Tanisha Daharwal](https://github.com/tanishadaharwal), [Prashant Singh](https://github.com/prashant531) and [Devanshu Dhawan](https://github.com/TheProBro), for the Inter IIT Tech Meet 12.0 held at IIT Madras in December, 2023.
