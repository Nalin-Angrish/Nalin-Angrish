### About me   
I am Nalin Angrish, a Schoolboy, Art Lover, and an Enthusiastic Coder. In the present age of technology, the whole world is trying to participate in its development and I wish to contribute to Open Source ideas and innovations which can be used by one and all. I also wish to help others like me who want to learn to code and need any help.   
### My Favourite creation   
[IScan - the Indian Scanner App](http://www.nalinangrish.me/apps/iscan)   
This is a purely Indian Scanner app that provides you with an easy to use interface, quick usage and completely safe way of scanning as PDFs, Saving and Sharing them. This app turns your Android device into a fast, lightweight and portable document scanner. This application allows you to easily scan documents and share them using your preferred mode of file sharing.    
### What I Do
I am a student and I learn to code and build some real-life projects. I create apps, both mobile and desktop apps, and websites. Along with learning and building, I compete with others and create some more projects for participating in [Hackathons](https://github.com/Nalin-2005/HackList). Want to see some of my projects? Visit [my website](http://www.nalinangrish.me). I also run a blog which would help others to learn to code and to improve their existing knowledge in the field of technology and science.
